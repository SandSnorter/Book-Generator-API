# Book Generator API
This repository contains the code for Book Generator API which is a single page application (SPA) built with React and Vite! In this project, I replicated the entire Book Generator API webpage, including all key sections such as pricing, navigation, and more, while implementing various interactive features and maintaining high standards of code quality and design fidelity.

## Features
- Full Page Replication.
- The application is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
- Dark/Light Theme Toggle.
- Implemented a single-page navigation system that allows users to navigate through different components without refreshing the page.
